MENU MANAGER

        MenuManager provides a menu-driven 'front end' to the MicroSoft
        Disk Operating System (MSDOS) for casual and inexperienced
        users.

        MenuManager menus are defined using a proprietary Menu
        Definition Language (MDL) which is translated by MenuManager
        into a batch language file. On this computer that batch file is
        called MENU.BAT.

        Users wishing to redefine their own menus should read the file
        MM.DOC which describes the MenuManager MDL. The MicroSoft User's
        reference should also be consulted regarding the format of MSDOS
        batch language commands.

        Ultimately, MenuManager does not do away with the need to learn
        about MSDOS. Rather it provides the means to use one's computer and
        preserve one's sanity in the learning process.
