A menuing system for DOS written in Turbo Pascal 5.5

I wrote this while working for the PC Support Group at Curtin University. It was originally copyrighted by the University and used extensively within it. 

Example menus are in menus folder.

Source is MM.PAS

Extra source for units is in the units folder.

MenuMgr.TXT and MMHELP.TXT give data on how to run the system.
